Barber Studio Website Pitch

Hi Neshi,

I put together a website for Barber Studio because I noticed you don’t have one yet. I’m building my portfolio and I wanted to practise with a real barber shop, so I used Barber Studio as the example.

The idea was simple: make it easy for people to find you, see what you do, and book quickly from their phones.

What’s on the website
	•	A clean homepage that looks professional
	•	Services section (so people stop asking the same questions)
	•	Reviews (to build trust for new clients)
	•	Your address, hours and contact details in one place
	•	Quick booking that opens WhatsApp with a ready message
	•	A contact form for people who prefer typing a message

Why this helps you

A lot of people choose a barber fast. If they search “barber near me” and they only see a Google listing with limited info, they usually move on. A website makes you look more serious, and it helps customers decide quicker.

It also saves you time because people can see the basics before they call or message:
services, hours, location, and what to do to book.

How someone would use it

Someone finds Barber Studio on Google or gets your link on WhatsApp/Instagram.
They open the site, see the services, and tap “Book on WhatsApp”.
That’s it. They’re already messaging you.

If you like it

This website is currently a template I made as a starting point. If you’re interested, we can:
	•	keep this one and just replace the photos/text with your real content
	•	or build a more custom version based on exactly what you want (your style, your photos, your wording, anything)

Pricing (fair and simple)

If you want to buy the template and I set it up for you (domain + hosting + your real info added), I can do it for R1,500 once-off.

If you want a more custom version with proper photos, extra pages, and a stronger “brand look”, we can do it from R3,500 depending on what you want.

If you want, I can send you the link to view it on your phone and you can tell me what you think.
