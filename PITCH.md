Hi Neshi,

I noticed Barber Studio doesn’t have a website yet, so I built one as a demo while I’m building my portfolio. The idea was to make it easy for people to find you online, see what you offer, and book quickly from their phones.

What the website includes:
	•	Clean, modern design that looks good on mobile and desktop
	•	Services section so people can see what you do without asking
	•	One-tap WhatsApp booking button (opens a ready message)
	•	Reviews section to build trust for new clients
	•	Your hours, address and contact details in one place
	•	Optional contact form + Google Maps

Why it helps:
Most people search “barber near me” and decide fast. A website makes you look more professional, answers the common questions quickly, and pushes people to book on WhatsApp instead of leaving.

If you like it, we can keep it close to what I made or adjust it to your exact style (photos, wording, colours, extra sections, anything).

Pricing options:
Basic – R3,500
A full professional website like the demo: mobile-friendly, services, WhatsApp booking, and basic SEO setup.

Standard – R5,500
Everything in Basic, plus a contact form that sends you emails, Google Maps added, and I handle updates/changes for 3 months (text, photos, services updates).

Premium – R8,500
Everything in Standard, plus help setting up/improving your Google Business Profile for better visibility, social media links, and updates for 6 months. Premium includes the first 3 months hosting free.

Hosting:
R150/month (keeps the website online).

If you want, I can send you the link to view it on your phone and you can tell me what you think.
